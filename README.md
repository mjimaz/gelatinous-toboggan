# Quilt

Quilt is social video creation on your iPhone. Invite friends to contribute to a video montage.

## Usage
Users can start a video montage (what we call a 'Quilt') by recording a video within the app and selecting friends to join in. As friends as their contributions, Quilt creates a running montage of all the videos. For a visual map of UX, take a look at the storyboard diagram.

## Tech Stack

## Development
### Installing Dependencies
Be sure to have Xcode 7.2.1+ installed. The repo contains both the server and the client app in seperate directories. Follow the instructions in each directory to get the full app up and running.
